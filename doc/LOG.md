### Dates
March 29:
  - Started this project for fun and to have an extra tool for designing DSP systems.
  - Thought I could do it in 2 weeks, but I soon realized it was a to big of a project.
  - I've made a small test for the click signal, but the Makefile kept not working. So I started reading the Make manual. Did this for the most part of the next two weeks.

April 11th:
  - Thought about what I wanted to do for this project and wrote this in the README.md.
  - Created this LOG.md.

April 14th:
  - Fixed the Makefile. Project compiles now.
  - Makefile still needs to be recursive.

April 16th:
  - Pitched my idea in front of class. Got a green light.
  - Figured some things out about the implicit and pattern rules of Makefiles and the use for them.

April 17th - 20th:
  - Still struggling with the makefile and the project structure I have. I'm turning the internet upside down in the hopes to find a good example or useful tips.
